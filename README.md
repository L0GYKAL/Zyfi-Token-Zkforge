# Ondefy (ODY) Solidity Project

## Overview

This project involves the development of Solidity contracts to implement the tokenomics of Ondefy (ODY). The contracts are built using Foundry and are intended for deployment on the ZkSync network. The primary contracts developed in this project are:

1. **Staking Contract for ODY Token**
   - Allows users to stake ODY tokens.
   - Supports the minting of a non-transferable stODY token.
   - Enables the distribution of ODY rewards and yield in any ERC20 token.
   - Implements a cooldown period for users wishing to withdraw from the staking contract.

2. **Escrowed Token Contract**
   - Creates an escrowed token (esODY) that can be minted from ODY by the team.
   - Implements an "airdrop" mechanism to distribute esODY to any address.
   - Escrowed tokens behave similarly to staked tokens but remain locked until the user triggers unvesting.
   - Unescrowing/unvesting results in burning esODY and distributing ODY tokens over a 6-month period.

## Contract Details

### Staking Contract (Staking.sol)

The Staking contract facilitates staking of ODY tokens and provides functionality for managing staked tokens, rewards, and cooldown periods for withdrawals.

Key Features:

- Staking ODY tokens.
- Minting stODY tokens.
- Distributing rewards in any ERC20 token.
- Implementing a cooldown period for withdrawals.

### Escrowed Token Contract (EscrowedToken.sol)

The Escrowed Token contract manages the creation and distribution of esODY tokens, which are minted from ODY tokens and locked until unvesting is triggered.

Key Features:

- Creating and minting esODY tokens from ODY.
- Airdropping esODY tokens to any address.
- Locking of escrowed tokens until unvesting is initiated.
- Burning esODY tokens and distributing ODY tokens over a 6-month period upon unvesting.

## Deployment

To deploy the contracts on the ZkSync network, follow these steps:

Requires *Foundry* and *zkfoundry*.

1. Use `forge compile` to compile the code and install the dependencies
2. Use `forge test` to run the tests
3. Use `zkforge zk-build` to gnerate the contracts circuit for ZkSync

## Usage

Once deployed, interact with the contracts using appropriate methods provided by each contract. Refer to the contract documentation for detailed information on available methods and their usage.
